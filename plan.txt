// When Chrome Extension icon is clicked, open pop up showing all tabs. 
// At the top of the pop up, there is a select all button.
// Each tab is represented as a box with a checkbox on the left and the Page Title in the middle.
// At the bottom of the pop up, there is an input form that the user can type in their prompt.
// Below the input form, there is a 'Send' button.
// When the 'Send' Button is clicked, a UUID is generated for each of the tabs selected and all the other tabs are hidden.
// Background.js then sends sends a message to the content script (page.js), telling it to extract the text from the pages that have been selected by the user.
// Page.js returns the extracted text as an array to background.js.
// Background.js then sends a message to the ChatGPTWebBot, which includes the UUID for each tab that's been selected to be processed, the text extracted from that tab, and the prompt that was provided by the user. 
// ChatGPTWebBot generates the necessary authentication tokens, and the request payload message.
// There should be one request payload per tab that was selected and extracted.
// ChatGPTWebBot then sends this information to the ChatGPTClient.
// For each request payload, ChatGPTClient sends the request payload to ChatGPT, parses the response from ChatGPT (Server Sent Events or SSE) and then sends the response back to background.js
// As each request is being processed, there should be a loader on the right hand side of the box that represents the tab that's been selected
// When the response from ChatGPT is done, the loader on the right hand side of the box should turn into a green checkmark and the text from the tab should be contained in another box underneath the tab box which is collapsible and expandable.
// The default state for this output box should be collapsed.
// When the output box is clicked, it should open and display the response generated by ChatGPT, formatted in rich text format.
// There should be a button on the top of the output box that allows the user to copy the text in the output box when clicked.
